# Novel TCR alleles

### JH @ MGH, 2022

This repo aims to gather together published novel TCR V gene alleles as-yet not included in IMGT/GENE-DB, either inferred from full-variable domain spanning TCR-seq reads or observed directly in long-read genomic DNA. Currently this table collates alleles from:

* [Rodriguez *et al*., 2022, *BioRvix*](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.24.493244)
* [Omer & Peres *et al*., 2022, *Genome Medicine*](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-01008-4)
* [Heather *et al*., 2022, *Nucleic Acids Research*](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac190)

#### Possible to do

* Find/include other studies?
* Include other gene types?
* Assign standardised names? 
* Include gapped sequences?
